# InvoiceReader

Python application to parse supplier invoices, provinding input to an accountant software.
The user selects an invoice template within those available, and taking advantage of Google's Tesseract OCR technology, the app reads the data of the incoming hand-written invoices and parses the information to an easy to use format.

Python main libraries used: tkinter, pytesseract, pandas, PIL-Image, threading, queue, concurrent.futures, numpy, cv2, etc.
